### BoxDrop is a simple file upload PHP/Apache/MySQL application, with a deliberately amusing design

#### The login/register form

BoxDrop is a web application made for the CS372 (Web Application) course as a final project made with a team of 3. I wrote 90% of the backend PHP and 60% of the frontend HTML.

It's designed to be overly cartoonish. When we were presenting our final projects to the class, most project designs were minimalistic and serious, so to present directly after them with something as silly as this turned out to be a huge success. After every team presented, the professor held a vote, and our team won, beating out ~8 other teams.

#### If browsers support the filetype, it's displayed rather than downloaded

#### User passwords are stored hashed and salted for increased security
