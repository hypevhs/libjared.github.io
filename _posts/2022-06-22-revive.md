I've come a long way since my last post in 2016. There's a lot to write about.
Let's start by showing how a recent obsession of mine, applying Nix to every
project, has finally spread to this very blog.

I have been using Nix/NixOS a lot. I like being able to capture a complicated,
environment-specific setup process in a single command. I like being able to
make patches to any software by compiling on a buildbot rather than my tiny
Chromebook. It has gotten to the point where every PC in the house is included
in my gigantic config repo.

Now, each of my projects have a complete, portable, version-tracked,
easy-to-use, and language-agnostic method to build it or set up its dev
environment, without distro-specific dependency fetching instructions or
home directory cruft.

This site uses Jekyll. Before long, it, too, was being built via Nix. Here's
how it works.

Jekyll is a Ruby program. Any plugins are specified in Gemfile and Gemfile.lock
files. For this site, that's `github-pages`, `jekyll-feed`, and `jemoji`. The
lockfile specifies each gem in the dep tree with its version. From this, I can
run `TODO what?` and generate a `gemset.nix` file. This is like Gemfile.lock
but is in the form of a Nix expression, that also specifies the sha256 hash of
each gem.

The `flake.nix` file is where it all begins. I specify two packages,
`perrycode` and `perrycode-watch`. They are both derivations with a single
output each, but the former yields a directory containing the generated site,
and the latter yields a shell script that wraps `jekyll serve`.

Now, I can run `nix build` to generate the site, and `nix run` to host it
locally, watching for changes. The cool part is that this works on *any*
machine that has Nix installed, regardless of distro, even WSL.

If I ever run into a problem where nokogiri (or some other troublesome gem)
needs a C source patch to work with new versions of glibc (just a hypothetical,
but a plausible one), it'd just be a six-line change to `flake.nix`, at most.

In the future, I would like for Nix to replace all language-specific dependency
managers. Nobody likes solving a problem by deleting `node_modules`, re-running
`npm install`, and hoping for the best.
